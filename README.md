# opsdroid connector shell

A connector for [opsdroid](https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid) to send messages using the command line.

## Requirements

The shell connector requires access to user input, this means you should probably set the logging not to go to the console. 

## Configuration

```yaml
# Optional
logging:
  console: false
```
